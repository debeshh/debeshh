## Hi

I’m Debesh Behera — a passionate developer walking the path of knowledge (*gyana*) and creation (*karma*). I believe in building with purpose, learning with devotion, and coding with clarity.

### Who I Am
From a young age, I was captivated by how things worked, always curious and eager to learn. This curiosity eventually led me to the world of coding, where I began solving problems and crafting meaningful web experiences.

Now, I’m diving deep into the MERN stack and Machine Learning, driven by the belief that “Yogah karmasu kaushalam” excellence is found in action. For me, every bug is a lesson, and every line of code is a step toward mastery.

Always open to collaboration, new ideas, or just a chat about tech. Let’s build something amazing together.
